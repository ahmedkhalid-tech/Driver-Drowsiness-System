# Driver-Drowsiness-System
A driver drowsiness system is a technology designed to detect and alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or fatigue while operating a vehicle. The main objective of such a system is to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue, which can significantly impair a driver's reaction time and decision-making abilities.

The program provided is a code implementation of a driver drowsiness system using a neural network. The system utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which contains examples of drowsy and awake states captured through various sensors or video monitoring. The neural network is trained on this dataset to learn patterns and features that distinguish between drowsy and awake states, enabling it to predict and classify the driver's condition.

The program preprocesses the dataset by converting labels to numerical values and splitting it into training and testing sets. The input features, representing images or sensor data, are normalized and reshaped to be compatible with the neural network architecture.

The neural network model is created using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library. It consists of convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers, which allow the network to learn hierarchical representations and make predictions based on the input data. The model is compiled with an appropriate loss function and optimizer to optimize its performance during training.

During the training process, the model is trained on the labeled training data, iteratively adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the loss and improve its accuracy. After training, the model is evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance and generalization abilities.

The final output of the program is the test accuracy, which provides an indication of how well the trained model can classify drowsy and awake states. This driver drowsiness system can be further enhanced and integrated into real-time applications or in-vehicle systems to detect and alert drivers in case of drowsiness, potentially preventing accidents and improving road safety.
